                It all started with 2 students from Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley, Jerry Yang and David Filo. Today they have founded Yahoo! one of the hottest sites on the web. Their big break started when they wanted to heck Stanford’s fantasy basketball league. Those Electronic Engineering students with their access to the web, especially David acquired all the data form earlier night’s game, punched it in, and tried figuring out whether they should bet on, trade or change the players. It was a fantasy for virgin web users, how to find, browse and surf over the stuffs online. Unlike today, it was just compilation of categories and subcategories.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2007 Google and Yahoo! alone generated billions of dollars, but still no one used it for business or commerce. Then the era of advertisement took over and still reluctant to choose their faith, they had their views.

                On 13th October 1994, ‘Navigator’ browser was launched by NetScape. It got millions of downloads.
                Microsoft realised that they were not the only giants in the IT industry anymore.
                Bill Gates was shook by NetScape’s success and sent out a memo called ‘Internet Tidal Wave’ where he
                declared that the Web is the single most important component and that they had to match the level of
                NetScape or get better and beat NetScape.

                By 1995, the Internet was a global phenomenon. NetScape started expanding their business. They fired
                Gary Reback, an antitrust lawyer who worked and fought for companies in the Silicon Valley, such as
                Microsoft.

                Microsoft arranged a meeting with NetScape and offered them 1M$ to buy NetScape or else they told them
                that they would copy their idea regardless, so might as well make money out of it but this was against
                the law so NetScape asked Reback to sue Microsoft, who felt that this was just a huge setup by NetScape.

                NetScape wanted to go public with an IPO but Wall Street had only allowed companies with at least 2
                years business experience period whereas NetScape only had 1 year of this experience. However, on the
                day of the IPO release, their stocks went through the roof. They had invested 5M$ which on the day of
                the IPO release went up to 663M$.

                NetScape became arrogant like Microsoft. Jim Clark announced publicly that he thought Microsoft was not
                relevant anymore and that Microsoft was a dead company.

                On December 7 1995, Microsoft let the world know that they were not done yet with the release of the
                Internet Explorer in order to beat NetScape. In 1995 people referred to the browser as NetScape but this
                was about to change. NetScape was in trouble as Microsoft had better salesmen and better marketing teams
                which were their hidden weapons. Their salesmen convinced people to not install anything other than
                Internet Explorer.

                Bill Gates was taken to court where he was asked many questions regarding the 1995 meeting, he had with
                Netscape, he denied all the accusations made but there was email evidence of him saying all the things
                that he was accused for.

                Bill Gates was found guilty and there was a verdict to split the company, as the news about this spread,
                their stocks were affected overnight and it went down by 30Bn$. Gates was sick after all this took
                place; the Court felt that the verdict was too harsh so they decided to take back the verdict of
                splitting the company. However, Gates gave up his position as CEO and appointed Steve Ballmer as
                Microsoft’s new CEO.
