                Internet, when we think about this word, we can quickly think of the scope as well rapidly changing
                technologies that have become the backbone of the modern era changes. Internet is not destined to one
                person.
                It is the fruitful collaboration of a number of scientists, program planners, engineers who each contributed
                to bring the
                internet to its current form. </p>

            <p>
                Before the invention of the Internet, scientists around the world already were expecting such a connected
                network.  Shortly after that, computer scientists developed the concept of “packet switching”
                which is a form of electronic data transfer that became the building blocks for internet architecture.
                Nikola Tesla stated “the world wireless system” around the 1900's, where Paul Outlet and Vanesvar Bush
                came up with the concept of a mechanical
                search system for storage of books and media in the mid-1900's. </p>

                On 13th October 1994, ‘Navigator’ browser was launched by NetScape. It got millions of downloads.
                Microsoft realised that they were not the only giants in the IT industry anymore.
                Bill Gates was shook by NetScape’s success and sent out a memo called ‘Internet Tidal Wave’ where he
                declared that the Web is the single most important component and that they had to match the level of
                NetScape or get better and beat NetScape.

                By 1995, the Internet was a global phenomenon. NetScape started expanding their business. They fired
                Gary Reback, an antitrust lawyer who worked and fought for companies in the Silicon Valley, such as
                Microsoft.
